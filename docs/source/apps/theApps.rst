Applications and tests
=======================

This section provides a short summary on the available **ready-to-use applications**, 
provided by the toolkit developers. These applications are located under the 
:math:`apps/examples` directory and each of the sub-directories contains a 
standalone set of applications that belong to a given machine learning problem 
family. The content of each sub-directory can be built and used individually 
to solve the related machine learning problems immediately after the :math:`leuven` 
library and framework has already been installed on the system. Moreover, each 
of these set of applications contains 
their own documentation and user guides to give insight into the usage of the 
provided applications. Since all the information regarding their installation 
and usage are available in their individual documentation, only a short summary 
of the available applications is given below.

One example (there is only this one at the moment) is the 
**sparse Kernel Spectral Clustering** related 
applications that are available under the :math:`apps/examples/KSC` directory. 
See `documentation and user guide of these KSC applications <https://leuven-ksc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for all the details
regarding how to build and use them.
